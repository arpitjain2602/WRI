The District Level Committee should ensure that the records of prior recorded nistari or other traditional community rights (such as Khatian part II in Jharkhandrights in Himachal and Uttarakhand) are provided to Gram Sabhasto be recorded in writingb.

The plan had outlined the strategies and action points for wildlife conservation which are still changes in consumption patterns are causing greater demographic impacts.  Biodiversity conservation has thus become a focus of interest.  The National Forest Policy was also Action Plan.  Overview • The term wildlife encompasses all uncultivated flora and undomesticated fauna. Every species has the right to live and every threatened species must be protected to prevent its extinction. richest repositories of wildlife and biodiversity have either shrunk or disappeared. Their continued existence is crucial for the long-term survival of the biodiversity and the ecosystems supporting them. • Effective ecosystem conservation is the foundation of long-term ecological and cyclones.  Thereby they ensure food security and regulate climate change.  They sustenance of local communities.   • India ranks sixth among the 12-mega biodiversity countries of the world.  Conservation of biodiversity is directly linked with conservation of ecosystems and thus with water and food security.   These together constitute a major plank of Indian economy.   • National planning has not taken into account the adverse ecological consequences of shrinkage and degradation of wilderness from the pressures of population and and geomorphological features. official gazettes may be consulted for authenticity.

This underscores the need to realign development priorities to take into account ecological imperatives • Rural development for communities inhabiting forestlands and other wilderness regions suffers both from inadequate resources and inappropriate measures. It has failed to address their strong dependence upon natural biomass resources vis-à-vis the shrinking and degrading resource base. Farm productivity has also declined upon natural areas. Resource impoverished communities have therefore begun to place even greater pressure on the biomass of our forests and has led to widespread alienation of people from the goals of nature conservation efforts. compound the problems of wildlife conservation. • The constraining impact of habitat loss has been compounded by illegal trade fuelled by a rising demand of wildlife products and their lucrative prices in the international market. Policy Imperatives development agenda must recognise the imperative of identifying and protecting natural gains must not be permitted to undermine ecological security. Priority to Conservation: Assigning conservation a high priority both at the level of central and state governments is an imperative. Its integration in all development allocations and provision of adequate personnel with requisite expertise has to be National Land Use Policy: The NWAP cannot be executed in isolation. Wildlife conservation cannot be restricted to national parks and sanctuaries. Areas outside the protected area network are often vital ecological corridor links and must be protected to Land and water use policies will need to accept the imperative of strictly protecting ecologically fragile habitats and regulating use elsewhere.

If not controlled wildlife conservation. It may even result in extinction of some plants and animals and increased incidences of livestock predation and sometimes loss of human life by carnivores. This has alienated the communities in several locations and they tend to resort to revenge killings and sometimes connive with poachers. Man-animal conflict situations require urgent amelioration to avoid these becoming a source of retaliatory action against parts and products. This trend has to be reversed. Although some efforts have been made for better coordination between wildlife managers and law and order enforcement and related law enforcement. provisions of the treaty to ban international commercial trade in Appendix-I species of plants and animals and regulate trade in Appendix-II and III species. little scope to devise suitable strategies to combat it effectively. Wildlife crime detection and follow-up is conducted in an ad hoc manner by most enforcement agencies due to lack of investigation skills and infrastructure. Large number of court cases dealing with wildlife crime continue to remain as punishment awarded is often meagre. Slow rate of conviction in court proceedings evidence stage. Insufficient or badly presented evidence often coupled with non-courts. There is urgent need to provide adequate professional skills in prosecution matters related to wildlife offences for the frontline staff.

Monitoring and Research   Overview and objectives conservation status of species and habitats and the extent of impact of conservation endeavours undertaken. Such understanding will also help reduce man-animal conflicts. There is a marked deficiency in baseline biological data and on information we need to manage and monitor PAs. We know little about the impact of human activities on Decisions to exploit resources in PAs are often based on expediency rather than hard data and this sometimes results in permanent damage to fragile ecosystems. Experimental research on alternatives to resources from the wild habitats is vital. There is need to establish benchmarks for measuring diversity and to monitor the status of indicator/flagship/threatened species of flora and fauna and their breeding biology. Applied research is also needed to help overcome specific management problems in protected areas.

Wildlife conservation and PA management are often neglected in relation to other for wildlife training and postings. The lack of opportunities for promotion in wildlife postings and the current recruitment process of IFS candidates exacerbates this situation. A premium on the right aptitude and commitment towards wildlife and nature must be volunteers. People trained in wildlife must be given wildlife postings. Professionals dedicated solely to protection of wildlife are crucial to achieve wildlife conservation objectives. professional growth. Universities should initiate undergraduate and graduate courses in wildlife biology and EIA techniques. Wildlife Institute of India (WII) is the main training facility in order to train Indian Forest Service (IFS) and State Forest Service (SFS) officers as well as the Forest Rangers whose responsibility is to protect and manage wildlife in the States/UTs. The frontline staff is to manage PAs. The availing of WII’s training programmes by States falls far short of often there is little consistency in wildlife postings. Aberrations surface as short tenures on postings in PAs as well as posting of available trained officers on non-wildlife jobs. Paucity of funds is a major stated reason for under-utilisation of WII’s training programmes. This is also the reason for inadequate training facilities in States for frontline staff.  A real cause for this deficiency is the continuing low priority assigned to the forestry integration of wildlife and forest management is considered essential in view of the dependence of PAs upon neighbouring forests for viability and because a significant official gazettes may be consulted for authenticity.

Ensuring Peoples’ Participation in Wildlife Conservation Overview and objectives An age-old feature of forest as well as non-forest natural tracts in India is an intimate interspersion of human habitation through them. The people here have all along been supplementing and socio-cultural well being. A variety of external factors such as increased commercial extraction of timber and other forest produce to meet urban populations have led to widespread shrinkage and degradation of these natural areas. This has adversely affected the people as well as the conservation status of forests and wildlife. Rural development as packaged for these areas has all along failed to take into account the strong linkage between effective conservation of such areas and the sustainable This is further compounded by the inadequate per capita inputs that have been going into rural development in these regions. These long-standing deficiencies have been widespread impoverishment of people. habitat conservation. It is now well recognised that the local communities are put to a lot of the forest usufructs and other natural produce like fish and other marine products. They are also exposed to the threats from wild animals to life and property. For effective conservation of wildlife it is necessary that Government of India launches programmes communities and for the damage caused to life and property by wild animals. There have been complaints about forced displacement of the people from the areas where they have been living for generations. A conscious effort should be made by the government to ensure that as far as possible the relocation and rehabilitation should be official gazettes may be consulted for authenticity.

However there should on natural resources of the Protected Areas. Commercialisation of a host of non-wood forest produce (NWFP) including medicinal exploitation of the forests. The traditional conservation ethos stands compromised in many situations and the collection practices as now employed cause heavy damage to the forest management strategies have also generally failed to see these factors of the vicious cycle of attrition. The recent responses by way of Joint Forest Management (JFM) initiatives have been inadequate in scale and varying in the quality of genuine stakeholder compounding the already impaired efficacy of conservation. Fragmentation of wildlife habitats has also enhanced the levels of damage to crops and livestock from wild animals other measures to prevent crop degradation have been carried out departmentally. The government should encourage such initiatives at an individual level so that they can look after the maintenance of the barriers. Such initiatives will also prevent isolation of the populations in Protected Areas. Only co-ordinated and balanced strategies for forest and wildlife management and rural development can help reverse these adverse trends. Local stakeholder-based genuine participation of people in both planning and implementation of such programmes aided which sought to evolve prescriptions for the management of multiple use areas in support mitigated and their support can be secured for conservation by reviving their stake in natural areas.
